runs a mini simulation to quantify gains from the arcane secondary enervate.

results can be found in the data folder.

the crit mod payoff graph and log assume, that the crit chance before enervate is achieved with creeping bullseye equiped.
that means the payoff value given is the part of your crit chance, that is being added by the mod.
so if it is 30%, than about one third of your final crit chance comes from the mod creeping bullseye.
